#' @description This function provides the number of days in each month, given a year and month. This script was originally part of the date.picker() function, but was separated since it might be useful on its own
#' @note It accounts for leapyears from 1904-2096.  Leapyears are not simply every 4 years - please look it up should this script live long enough to need modification 
#' @param \code{the.year} YYYY
#' @param \code{the.month} MM
