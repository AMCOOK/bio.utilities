\description{
This function provides the number of days in each month, given a year and month. This script was originally part of the date.picker() function, but was separated since it might be useful on its own
}
\note{
It accounts for leapyears from 1904-2096.  Leapyears are not simply every 4 years - please look it up should this script live long enough to need modification
